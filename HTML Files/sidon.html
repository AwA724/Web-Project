          <h2>History & Description</h2>
          <p>
            Sidon, known as Saida in Arabic, is one of the most ancient Phoenician cities, with a history stretching back over 6,000 years to approximately 4000 BCE. As one of the most important city-states of ancient Phoenicia, Sidon was renowned throughout the ancient world for its maritime prowess, glass-making industry, and purple dye production. The city's name appears frequently in ancient texts, including Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, where Sidonian craftsmen were celebrated for their exceptional skill.

            The iconic Sidon Sea Castle stands as the city's most recognizable landmark, built by the Crusaders in 1228 CE on a small island connected to the mainland by a causeway. The fortress was constructed using stones from earlier Phoenician and Roman structures, incorporating materials that had witnessed millennia of history. The Crusaders built this strategic fortification to protect the harbor and control maritime access to the city during their occupation of the Holy Land.

            After the Crusader period, the castle underwent modifications under Mamluk and Ottoman rule. The fortress features impressive defensive architecture including thick walls, arrow slits, a main tower, and vaulted chambers. The causeway connecting the castle to the shore was originally built by the Crusaders but has been reinforced over the centuries, creating the dramatic approach visitors experience today.

            Beyond the Sea Castle, Sidon boasts numerous historical treasures including the Temple of Eshmun, one of the best-preserved Phoenician religious sites, the Khan al-Franj caravanserai, and a labyrinthine old souk dating back centuries. The city's ancient harbor continues to serve as a working fishing port, maintaining its maritime tradition that has defined Sidon for thousands of years. Today, Sidon Sea Castle stands as a powerful symbol of Lebanon's layered history, where Phoenician, Roman, Crusader, and Arab civilizations converge.
