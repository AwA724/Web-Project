          <h2>History & Description</h2>
          <p>
            Jeita Grotto is a magnificent system of two interconnected limestone caves located in the Nahr al-Kalb valley, approximately 18 kilometers north of Beirut. This natural wonder spans nearly 9 kilometers in length, making it one of the most spectacular cave systems in the Middle East. The grotto has been forming for millions of years through the geological process of karst dissolution, where water gradually carved through limestone rock to create breathtaking stalactites, stalagmites, and other crystalline formations.

            The lower grotto was rediscovered in 1836 by Reverend William Thomson, an American missionary who ventured 50 meters into the cave. However, the site remained largely unexplored until the 1950s when Lebanese speleologists began systematic exploration. In 1958, Lebanese cavers discovered the upper galleries, revealing an even more spectacular chamber adorned with extraordinary geological formations. The underground river flowing through the lower cave has been the primary source of water for Beirut for over a century.

            The lower grotto features an underground river that visitors explore by boat, gliding silently through illuminated chambers where water has sculpted otherworldly landscapes over millennia. The upper grotto, accessible by walkways, showcases massive halls filled with delicate curtain formations, towering columns, and the world's largest known stalactite, measuring 8.2 meters in length. The combination of both galleries creates an unforgettable journey through geological time.

            Jeita Grotto was a finalist for the New Seven Wonders of Nature competition in 2011, highlighting its global significance. Today, it stands as Lebanon's premier natural attraction and a symbol of the country's geological heritage, drawing visitors from around the world to witness nature's artistry carved in stone over countless millennia.
