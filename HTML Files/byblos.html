          <h2>History & Description</h2>
          <p>
            Byblos, known locally as Jbeil, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with archaeological evidence of settlement dating back to approximately 5000 BCE. The city's ancient name "Gebal" means "mountain" in Phoenician, while the Greek name "Byblos" is derived from the Greek word for papyrus, as the city was a major center for papyrus trade from Egypt to Greece. Interestingly, the English word "Bible" comes from Byblos, reflecting the city's deep connection to ancient writing and scholarship.

            Throughout its long history, Byblos served as a crucial Phoenician port city, establishing extensive trade networks across the Mediterranean. The city was particularly famous for its shipbuilding industry and cedar wood exports, with Lebanese cedar being highly sought after by ancient civilizations including Egypt, Mesopotamia, and later Rome. The Phoenicians of Byblos developed one of the earliest alphabetic writing systems, which became the foundation for Greek and Latin alphabets used today.

            The archaeological site of Byblos reveals layers of civilizations spanning millennia. Visitors can explore Neolithic dwellings, Bronze Age temples, a Phoenician royal necropolis, a Roman amphitheater, a Crusader castle built in the 12th century, and Ottoman-era structures. Each layer tells a story of the city's evolution through Phoenician, Egyptian, Persian, Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, and Crusader periods.

            The city's picturesque old harbor, still in use today, has witnessed thousands of years of maritime activity. Byblos was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, recognized for its exceptional testimony to the history of human civilization and its role as one of the most important cities of antiquity in the eastern Mediterranean.
