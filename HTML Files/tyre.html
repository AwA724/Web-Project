          <h2>History & Description</h2>
          <p>
            Tyre, known as Sour in Arabic, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, with origins dating back to approximately 2750 BCE. This ancient Phoenician metropolis was once the most powerful city-state in Phoenicia and served as a major maritime trading hub connecting the Mediterranean world. The Phoenicians of Tyre were legendary seafarers and traders who established colonies across the Mediterranean, including the famous city of Carthage in North Africa.

            The city's strategic location on the Mediterranean coast made it immensely wealthy through trade in purple dye, extracted from murex shells, which became known as "Tyrian purple" and was highly prized by royalty throughout the ancient world. Tyre's influence extended far beyond commerce; it was also a center of learning and culture, mentioned frequently in ancient texts including the Bible.

            In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great famously besieged Tyre for seven months, ultimately conquering it by building a causeway from the mainland to the island city. Later, under Roman rule, Tyre flourished once again, and the impressive ruins visitors see today primarily date from this Roman and Byzantine period. The site features a magnificent Roman hippodrome, one of the largest and best-preserved in the world, along with an extensive necropolis, a triumphal arch, and elaborate streets lined with colonnades.

            Today, Tyre's archaeological sites are divided into three main areas: the Al-Mina excavation site (the ancient harbor quarter), the Al-Bass site (featuring the hippodrome and necropolis), and the medieval city. In 1984, UNESCO designated Tyre as a World Heritage Site, recognizing its outstanding universal value as a testament to Phoenician civilization and its subsequent cultural layers.
